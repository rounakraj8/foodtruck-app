The first thing is to fetch data from the given public API. Since this is simple command-line application, I have used simple HttpURLConnection instead of clients like Rest Template or Feign client. We have to find food-trucks based on current date, so one thing that will help us to recieve a significantly less data from the API is using `dayorder` request-param. Then we need to do filtering based on the current date and each food-truck's time range. Now we have to sort the list alphabetically by name. To display the output I have used String.format and Sysout.

Since we are using JSON data from API, we need to use libraries to unmarshall the raw JSON data into Java objetcs, I have used jackson for this purpose. Jackson is added in pom dependency, so that we don't have to explicitly install this. For building the artifact I have used Maven.
